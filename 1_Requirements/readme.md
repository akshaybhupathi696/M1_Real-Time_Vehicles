# Introduction
This vehicle seat heat monitoring system is capable of heat in the vehicle seats. This system presents a Microcontroll(atmega328) based Seat measurement system to dectect and confirm the presence/absence of person on the seat. 
In this system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature need to be set accordingly. 
Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats.
 And whatever the heat is generated that point it will be displaying on displays like (Liquid crystal display (LCD),
Light emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD, Thin film Transistors (TFT) LCD).


## Features:
It is compitable.
Driver or passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
This system is reliable.
It sense whether the person is existed or not.
Modular Approach.
Low cost and robust system.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

## _Strength_
Low costUser friendly.
Robust in nature.

## _Weakness_
It is only applicable for the countries which are having low temperature.

## _Opportunities_
It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.

## _Threats_
Not suitable for average temperature environment.

## 4W's and 1H's:
WHAT : Passanger Seat and Heat Monitoring System.
WHERE : Used in automotive industry.
WHEN : At low temperature.
WHY : For being healthy.
HOW : Operates by modifying the temperature.
